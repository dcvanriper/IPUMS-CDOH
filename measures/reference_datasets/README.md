# Reference datasets
This directory contains reference datasets commonly used by different measures. For example, IPUMS-CDOH data files include state names and FIPS codes. To make sure we provide a consistent name and FIPS code, we use a state_fips.csv dataset we created. That state_fips.csv is available in this directory.

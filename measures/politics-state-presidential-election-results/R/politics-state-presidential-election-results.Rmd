## Description
The state presidential election results measure provides the proportion of a state's votes cast for the Democratic party or the Republican party in presidential elections from 1976-2020.  

## Input Data
MIT Election Data and Science Lab, 2017, "U.S. President 1976â€“2020", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/42MVDX, Harvard Dataverse, V6, UNF:6:4KoNz9KgTkXy0ZBxJ9ZkOw== [fileUNF]

## Geographic Detail

### Geographic Extent
Data are available for the United States.

### Geographic Units
Data are available for each US state and the District of Columbia.

## Temporal Detail

### Temporal Extent
The "U.S. President 1976-2020" dataset provides state-level election returns from 1976-2020. 

### Temporal Frequency
Data are available on an every four-year basis from 1976-2020. 

## Formula 
We compute the proportion of votes received by the Democratic or Republican party using the following formula:

$$
Prop_{ij} = \frac{Votes_{ij}}{Votes_i} 
$$
where $Prop_{ij}$ is the proportion of state $i$'s votes cast for party $j$, $Votes_{ij}$ are the number of votes cast in state $i$ for party $j$, and $Votes_i$ is the total number of votes cast in state $i$.  

## Interpretation
This measure represents the state-level proportion of votes cast for the Democratic or Republican party in each presidential election from 1976-2020.

## Description
Employment inequity is the ratio between the proportion of people aged 16-64, in the civilian labor force, who are employed and identify as White alone, not Hispanic or Latino and the proportion of people aged 16-64, in the civilian labor force, who are employed and identify as a different race/ethnic group. We have computed the employment inequity measure for the following groups:
  
  * White alone, not Hispanic or Latino:Black alone
* White alone, not Hispanic or Latino:Asian alone
* White alone, not Hispanic or Latino:Hispanic or Latino

## Input Data
Steven Manson, Jonathan Schroeder, David Van Riper, Katherine Knowles, Tracy Kugler, Finn Roberts, and Steven Ruggles. IPUMS National Historical Geographic Information System: Version 18.0 [dataset]. Minneapolis, MN: IPUMS. 2023. http://doi.org/10.18128/D050.V18.0

We use data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey 5-year summary files. 

## Data Tables
The following IPUMS NHGIS tables should be requested when creating the input dataset:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load the table code and label information
table_details <- read_csv(here::here("measures", topic, "data", "input", "table_code_label.csv"))

# Create a gt() table from table_details
table_details |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(table_id = "Table ID",
             table_name = "Table name") |> 
  cols_width(
    table_name ~ px(400)
  )
  
```

## Geographic Detail

### Geographic Extent
Data are available for the United States.

### Geographic Units
Data are available for counties or county equivalents in the United States.

## Temporal Detail

### Temporal Extent
The American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year summary data are released every year, and each 5-year summary file contains survey responses pooled over a 5-year time span. For example, the 2015-2019 ACS 5-year data include survey responses collected from 2015-2019. The 2016-2020 ACS 5-year data include survey responses collected from 2016-2020. 

In order to generate employment inequity measures for all counties in the United States, we must use the 5-year summary data. Other ACS data products, including the 1-year summary data, only include estimates for geographic units whose population exceeds a certain threshold. 

## Formula 
We compute the educational inequity ratio using the following formula:

$$
employment_{inequity_{ijk}} = \frac{prop_{employment_{ij}}}{prop_{employment_{ik}}} 
$$

where $employment_{inequity_{ijk}}$ is the employment inequity ratio in county $i$ between groups $j$ and $k$, $prop_{employment_{ij}}$ is the proportion of people aged 16-64, in the civilian labor, who are employed in county $i$ in group $j$, and $prop_{employment_{ik}}$ is the proportion people aged 16-64, in the civilian labor force, who are employed in county $i$ in group $k$.

The group-specific employment proportions are computed using the following formula:

$$
prop_{employment_{ij}} = \frac{N_{employment_ij}}{N_{ij}}
$$

where $prop_{employment_{ij}}$ is the proportion of people in county $i$ and group $j$ aged 16-64, in the civilian labor force, and are employed, and $N_{employment_ij}$ is the count of people in county $i$ and group $j$ aged 16-64 in the civilian labor force. 

## Interpretation
This measure compares the proportion of people in a particular race/ethnicity category who are aged 16-64, in the civilian labor force, and are employed with the proportion of people in a different race/ethnicity category who are aged 16-64, in the civilian labor force, and are employed. If the proportion for the numerator race/ethnicity category is greater than the proportion for the denominator race/ethnicity category, the ratio will be greater than 1.0. If the proportion for the numerator race/ethnicity category is less than the proportion for the denominator race/ethnicity category, the ratio will be less than 1.0.

For the measures in the data file, we use the White alone, not Hispanic or Latino category as the numerator for all the employment inequity ratios, and the denominator is one of the following three categories:

* Black or African American alone
* Asian alone
* Hispanic or Latino

Since the numerator and denominator are both percentages, the overall count of householders for a specific race/ethnicity category has less impact on the resulting ratio. 

## Missing data
We are unable to compute employment inequity ratios for some county - race/ethnicity combinations. If both the numerator and denominator proportions are zero, the employment inequity ratio is undefined. If the denominator proportion is zero, then the ratio is also undefined. When we observe these cases, we report the ratios as missing.
